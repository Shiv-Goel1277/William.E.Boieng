     <h1>Biography</h1><p> William Boeing was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Marie M. Ortmann, from Vienna, Austria, and Wilhelm Böing (1846–1890) from Hohenlimburg, Germany. Wilhelm Böing emigrated to the United States in 1868 and initially worked as a laborer. His move to America was disliked by his father and he received no financial support. He later made a fortune from North Woods timber lands and iron ore mineral rights on the Mesabi Range of Minnesota, north of Lake Superior.
            <br><br>
            In 1890, when William was eight, his father died of influenza, and his mother soon remarried. He attended school in Europe at Vevey, Switzerland, and returned to the U.S. for a year of prep school in Boston. He enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He left Yale in 1903 before graduating to go into the lumber business.
